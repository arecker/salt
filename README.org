#+TITLE: Salt
#+STARTUP: showeverything indent

[[https://travis-ci.org/arecker/salt][file:https://travis-ci.org/arecker/salt.svg?branch=master]]

These are my salt scripts, man.

* Configuring

This is an example salt pillar.

#+BEGIN_SRC yaml
  user:
    alex:
      fullname: Alex Recker
      groups: [ sudo ]
      password: $1$q4F2BscZ$ZtjM20u.3dEVuZxKEJYy..  # openssl passwd -1
      ssh:
        present:
          - ssh-rsa blah-blah-blah-real-ssh-key you@hostname
        absent:
          - ssh-rsa blah-bloop-blee-real-ssh-key guywhowasfired@hostname
#+END_SRC

Along with installing the specified users, these configs will install
an ssh server, a firewall, and setup docker.

* Bootstrapping

Run =fab -H yourhost= to bootstrap the new server as a salt-minion.
This must run as root on the remote host.
