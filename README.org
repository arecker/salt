These are my salt scripts, man.

* Bootstrapping

Servers (both masters and minions) are bootstrapped with the help of
fabric.  This is currently only supported on Debian Jessie.

1. Clone this repository on the machine to =/srv/salt=

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     root@localhost# git clone https://github.com/arecker/salt /srv/salt
   #+END_EXAMPLE

2. Install =fabric=

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     root@localhost# apt-get install fabric
   #+END_EXAMPLE

3. While in =/srv/salt=, run the fabric tasks to meet your needs.

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     root@localhost# pwd
     /srv/salt
     root@localhost# fab local repo minion
   #+END_EXAMPLE

The fabric tasks can be run remotely, or locally (with =local= as the
first task).
